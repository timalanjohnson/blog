The short answer is: "JAMstack and because I wanted to." But that isn't a good blog post - so I will give the long answer as well.

## Why

I thought it would be a good idea to have a place that I could share ideas and have full control over them. This is why I did not just set up a Medium blog or something along those lines. Truthfully, I don't yet know what I am going to write about, but at least now I have no excuse not to.

## How

I started by deciding that I wanted to use a static site generator for my blog. This would enable me to keep hosting costs down. In fact, I only pay for the domain. The source code is hosted on GitHub and deployed via Netlify.

Anyway, after deciding on GatsbyJS, the next step was to Google "blog with Gatsby". What can I say, I try not to overcomplicate matters. I arrived at [this post](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/) by Dave Ceddia and I basically followed every step to the letter.

However, I wasn't totally satisfied with the default stylings. I updated the typography and made a few other tweaks with CSS. However, this will probably change a lot. In fact, I suspect the site will feature more design overhauls than actual posts.

So, now that I had everything set up on my computer, it was time to publish the site. Like I mentioned earlier, the code is hosted on GitHub and deployed to Netlify. That was it - my website was online. But what is a website without a good domain? Nothing, that's what. The final step was pointing [timalanjohnson.com](http://timalanjohnson.com) to this website.

And that's how this blog came to life.
